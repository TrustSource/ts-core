# ts-core - the heart of TrustSource
Core of TrustSource, managing most of the service functionality, especially flow logic. See https://support.trustsource.io for more details.

## About
TrustSource is an open source solution for implementing an [OpenChain](https://www.openchianproject.org) compliant open source compliance process. It currently is availabe as source code (this repo) for an on-premises setup as self managed installation or as [managed service](https://app.trustsource.io). In a few weeks we also will provide a hosted version as an AWS marketplace offering. Learn more about the different options [here](https://www.trustsource.io/editions). It is also possible to obtain a support contract or [request consulting](https://www.eacg.de/contact).

Trainings and further materials can be found at the publicly accessible [TrustSource Knowledgebase](https://support.trustsource.io).
